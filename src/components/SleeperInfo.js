    <p>Over 13 years ago, Sunny, the founder of Sunshine Action, was a regular volunteer for a few charity organizations. One evening, he was called to help on distributing food to the street-sleepers in the Yaumatei area. The centre supplied volunteers with bread & butter plus a drink, for distribution.</p> 

 

<p>They started to walk the entire Yaumatei area, next to the wholesale fruit market of HKG, and distributed the food that evening. When Sunny came back home that evening, he discussed with his best friend that they would do it again themselves. They simply bought tuna, ham, tomatoes, lettuce, bread, cheese for sandwiches and walked the same roads. </p> 

 

<p>At that time, they both had full-time jobs, but luckily their office was close to home so the sandwiches could be packed right after office hours. Sunny carried all the sandwiches and his friend carried all the drinks. It was quite heavy for only 2 persons, but they continuing doing so for months to come.</p>

 

<p>They continued volunteering on the evenings of major Festive Holidays, including Parent's Days, the Mid-Autumn Festival, Christmas Eve, New Year’s Eve, etc. - these are the evenings those in need receive the least help. They decided to always be there, when no one else would be. For 13 years, Sunny has witnessed every evolution & revolution that happens in these areas. </p> 

 

<p>Within a year, Sunny & his friend created Sunshine Action, making this the oldest program within Sunshine Action having started doing it before the organization was even founded. </p>

    <p>For over a decade, Sunshine Action has had many types of volunteers, from primary students, youth, adults, lawyers, CEOs, etc… - donating mostly food and other goods, occasionally providing free hair-cut services. 
</p>
 <ul>

<li>The first multi-national corporation to have volunteered with the program was Bloomberg L.P. For a few years, they helped with distributing after their busy work days and Sunshine Action remains thankful to have had their support from the beginning. </li>
<br />  
<li>CEOs joining this event include Mr. Neil Harvey from Credit Suisse and Ms. Ligia Torres from BNP Paribas. </li>
<br />  
<li>Clifford Hart was the first Consul Gen. of U.S. who joined the program. </li>
</ul>

<p>Sunny learned something very important from him, a very unique leadership style. Normally, when heads or CEOs of corporations walked this program, they went in the front with him when guiding and explaining. Hart always walked at the back, overseeing the entire U.S. Consulate team like as a protector of his people. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Many U.S. Navy & Marines from different ships have joined this program. </li>
 </ul>

<p><u>Sunshine Ambassadors and the Street-Sleepers Program</u></p>

<p>During the major crisis in Hong Kong due to the Covid-19 outbreak, many Sunshine Ambassadors and students joined this program. They helped on a weekly basis by distributing essential food and anti-pandemic items.</p> 
<p>Since the first year of the pandemic, a dedicated team of volunteers have been taking care of the street-sleepers every Tuesday & Wednesday. They drive around to several spots in Hong Kong and Kowloon side, even during the typhoon.</p>

   <p><u>Legal Aid</u></p>
<ul>
<li>From January 2021, a group of third year Law students from the University of Hong Kong are cooperating with Sunshine Action to link up with lawyers offering pro bono legal aid to street-sleepers in Hong Kong. They will cover all street-sleepers shelters and several areas of Hong Kong. The project is target to last approx. 6-12 months. </li>
<li>The program includes temporary storage to help them store personal items while searching for new jobs or other activities.</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />

<p><u>Street-Sleepers & Homeless Program Assimilation in Schools:</u></p> 

<p>Sunshine Action have extended this project into schools in Hong Kong, 
helping educate them on the issue of homelessness and street sleeping as well as raising money 
for the charity.</p>

<p>Youth are educated on:</p> 
<ul>
<li>The history and evolution of the demographic of street-sleepers in Hong Kong within the last decade. </li>
<li>The difference between street-sleepers & homeless and how to classify them. </li>
<li>The types of street-sleepers in Hong Kong; the difference between locals and those from overseas. </li>
<li>Whether charity program ideas from overseas work in Hong Kong. </li>
<li>The mental health issues amongst street-sleepers. </li>
<li>Possible biases in how young people view street-sleepers.</li>
<li>The true impact of the Street-Sleeper Program and the importance of educating themselves on poverty. </li>
<li>The adaptations to the program when doing it under different seasons and environment. </li>
<li>Understanding which ideas would work when planning to help street-sleepers.</li> 
</ul>
<br />
<p>Bradbury School & Discovery College ESF have both advocated for the program inside of their schools 
    to raise fund for street-sleepers.</p>
<br />
<br />



<p><u>Further Donations:</u></p>

<p>Beside the actual street-sleepers, 
Sunshine Action have donated food in bulk alongside Sunshine Fortune Bags to several charity
 centres also helping the homeless in Hong Kong, including:</p> 
 <ul>
<li>ImpactHK</li>
<li>MercyHK - by Fr John Wotherspoon O.M.I .</li>  
<li>Missionaries of Charity Nam Cheong & Prince Edward Centers</li> 
<li>Society of Rehabilitation & Crime Prevention  </li>
<li>Street Sleepers' Shelter Society Trustees 3 shelters </li>
<li>St. Barnabas Home  </li>
<li>St. James Settlement  </li>
 </ul>

<br />
<p>In 2021, as is the same with most charity organizations, Sunshine Action is struggling to sustain all programs. Your contribution would mean a lots to us. </p>

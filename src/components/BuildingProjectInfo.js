    <p>Our Sunshine Folding Container Houses consist of brand-new mobile containers. They are a green and economical solution to the housing crisis. Each container is made from new steel sheets and includes water-proof and fire-proof insulation. They have a minimum lifespan of 13-15 years or more, depending on local weather conditions and maintenance.</p>



<p>These homes are designed to provide a quick housing solution in natural disaster zones, or to provide extra accommodation to orphanages or care homes.</p>



<p>The price of each home is lower than the cost of purchasing and renovating a second-hand container. They also avoid the possible risk to health that may come with a second-hand container that has been used to store dangerous chemicals. These houses are modular, meaning a row of one or even two storeys would fit together well. Stairs can be installed at one end of the row to provide access to the second storey.</p>

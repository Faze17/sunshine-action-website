    <br />

<div className="row">
    <div>
    <p>This was the first official program of SUNSHINE ACTION in 2008 and remains our biggest project after a decade. We started with the simple concept that "Everyone needs to Eat", calling our donations food bags and using the Festive Seasons as motivation to donate. 
</p>
 
 <p>The Biggest Sunshine Fortune Bags program packed in one single morning was Mid-Autumn 2020, donating over 7,500 Sunshine Fortune Bags for the poor & elderly in Hong Kong, through 70 local centres.</p>

<p>The first charity organization SUNSHINE ACTION donated Fortune Bags to was HK Women Workers Association and its sister org: Cleaning Worker's Association. In early 2008, there was no minimum wages scheme in Hong Kong. Most cleaning workers made an average of HK$3'500-4'500 PER MONTH, to pay the rent and sustain a small family therefore it was not possible to apply for social welfare.  They cleaned floors in office buildings, restaurants, etcâ€¦</p>

<p>When Sunny started the Sunshine Fortune Bags programs in 2008, every season there were only a few volunteers, from 3-6 to pack all bags. They borrowed the office from HK Women Workers Association to store the food. Volunteers came on Saturdays & Sundays for 3 consecutive weekends to pack them. Sunshine Action didn't have its own office until 4 years later and this was the humble beginning of the World's smallest Charity Organization.</p>

<p>The heaviest Sunshine Fortune Bags were packed during SEP 2020 for the Moon Festival & World Food Day containing 9-10 items and averaged 9 kg each bag.</p>

<p>The Most expensive Sunshine Fortune Bags program was completed in MAY 2019 for Mother's & Father's Day.  In terms of market value, the content of each bag was approximately HK $300. US$40/bag with 9 items and a total of 3,000 distributed during May & June, making it the single most expensive program ever done in the history of Sunshine Action. </p>

<p>Besides Hong Kong, SUNSHINE ACTION began providing the fortune bag program in Macau in 2011 and donated to the poor cases through the following organizations:</p>

<p>Occasionally, we donated to the Food Recycle & local charity kitchen in bulk:</p>

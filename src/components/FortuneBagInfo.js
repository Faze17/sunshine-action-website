    <br />

<div className="row">
    <div>
    <p>This was the first official program of Sunshine Action in 2008 and remains our biggest project after more than a decade. We started with the simple concept that "Everyone Needs to Eat", called our donations Fortune Bags, and used the Festive Seasons as motivation to donate.</p>
 <p>The first charity organization to which Sunshine Action donated Fortune Bags was HK Women Workers Association and its sister org: Cleaning Workers’ Association. At that time in early 2008, there was no minimum wage in Hong Kong. Most cleaning workers made an average of only $3,500-4,500 HK per month (£367.81- £472.90, or $446.07-$573.52 US). Many struggled to pay rent and sustain their families but could not apply for social welfare.</p>

<p>When Sunny started the Sunshine Fortune Bags program in 2008, every season there were only a few volunteers, from 3-6 to pack all bags. They borrowed the office from HK Women Workers Association to store the food. Volunteers came on Saturdays and Sundays for 3 consecutive weekends to pack the bags. Sunshine Action didn't have its own office until 4 years later. This was the humble beginning of Sunshine Action, and the world's smallest Charity Organization.</p>

<p>The Fortune Bag Program has since expanded outside of Hong Kong. Sunshine Action began providing Fortune Bags in Macau in 2011. Fortune Bags have also been distributed in Vietnam, Kenya, China, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Hong Kong, Mongolia, India, Nepal, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam & the Philippines. Occasionally, we also donate to local charity kitchens in bulk. In addition to distributing Fortune Bags, Sunshine Action has donated food to the poor through the following organizations:</p>
 
<li>- Blue Sky Food Assistance Serv. Project </li>
<li>- Crossroad Foundaion</li>
<li>- Feeding Hong Kong </li>
<li>- Food Angel </li>
<li>- Food Grace</li>
<li>- Foodlink Foundation </li>
<li>- Food for Good </li>
<li>- Food Friend Action</li>
<li>- Greener Action </li>
<li>- J Life Foundation</li>
<li>- K.T. Methodist Cleaners Community Food Bank </li>
<li>- Christian Action Kitchen for the Refugees</li>
<li>- Missionaries of Charity Nam Cheong shelter</li>
<li>- St. James Settlement People's Food Bank</li>
<li>- YWAM Food Bank Tuen Mun</li>

        <p>Sunshine Action works with schools to fundraise, package and distribute Fortune Bags. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, Sunshine Action had conducted the fortune bag program in the following schools in the last 3 years:</p>
        <li>Kowloon Wah Yan School </li> 
        <li>Yew Chung International School </li>
        <li>Hong Kong International School</li> 
        <li>ESF King George V School </li>
        <li>ESF Bradbury School  </li>
        <li>ESF Beacon Hill School  </li>
        <li>ESF Kennedy School </li>
        <li>ESF Discovery College </li>
        <li>ESF Renaissance College </li>
        <li>ESF West Island School </li>
        <li>Stamford American School Hong Kong </li>
        <p> </p>
        <p><u>How Do Schools Help?</u></p>
        <p>Schools can help support the Fortune Bag Program in several ways:</p>

    <li>Hosting an event – Fortune Bag events require a venue and space for short-term food storage.
        <ul>
            <li>Most food purchased by Sunshine Action would arrive 2-4 days before the packing event and normally in pallets. The items do not need to be stored inside rooms, but preferably under a roof to avoid potential rain.</li>
            <li>Schools must provide space for assembly lines to pack Fortune Bags. The open space should be fit for at least 6 assembly lines, with 3 long tables for each line.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fundraising and collecting donation items – items must be collected for distribution prior to the packing event.
        <ul>
            <li>The target for donations should be the target number of Fortune Bags x 3-4 items per bag. These items must be at least 6 months from expiry date and not be stored in glass containers. During the pandemic, protective masks and other anti-pandemic items are also welcome.</li>
            <li>Schools can also create fundraising events to support the purchase of items for donation.</li>
            <li>On average, the school and students involved collect 50% of the donated content and Sunshine Action covers the remaining 50%.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Providing volunteers – students, parents, and teachers should be involved and volunteering in the packing & distribution of these bags to the final beneficiaries.
        <ul>
        <li>Approximately 15 volunteers are needed per assembly line.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Contact Sunshine Action to learn more and organize an event at your school!</li>

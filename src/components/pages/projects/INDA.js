<SmallHeader text = "Shuktara Trusts - Shuktara Cakes" />
<ul>
<li>Many of the young people living in the boys’ house have reached an age when they can look for a job, but for years they have struggled to find work.</li>
<li>In 2013 this all changed. Two years previously Alain Cojean had spent some very special days at shuktara with the boys and he decided to help them. “I was so very impressed by so much love, they were like a family, so lovely, always taking care of one another, I felt immediately involved and I wanted to do something for them and David” said Alain, who runs a chain of restaurants in Paris called Cojean and a Foundation called Nourrir, Aimer, Donner (Eat, Love, Give) which supports other projects around the world. “David told me he was worried about what would become of the boys after him,” he continued. He was so touched by what he saw, that he decided to start a French Patisserie Training Centre to help the boys with their employment and training. Seven of the older boys (Sanjay, Ashok, Raju, Pinku, Vijay, Ramesh and Bapi), were taught baking and the art of French patisserie by a team including Fabien Rouillard, Head Executive Pastry Chef from Fauchön, a gourmet food company in Paris and on 10th March 2013, Shuktara Cakes was officially launched at the French Consulate in Kolkata.</li>
<li>Shuktara Cakes makes a selection of five cakes as well as financiers, a traditional French recipe shaped like small gold ingot, and madeleines, famous for their shell-like shape and the delicate baking. The shuktara boys are responsible for weighing the ingredients, operating the machinery and overseeing the complete production process. “My favourite job is cutting the baking paper in different sizes,” says Bapi.”I use equipment like the weighing machine and the brush to put non-stick oil in the moulds.” Sanjay enjoys being responsible for one of the most important items in the kitchen: “I start the oven, set the temperature and the timing of it,” he says. Raju and Ramesh prefer the task of accurately measuring out the different cake ingredients.</li>

<SmallHeader text = "Howarh South Point" />
<p>Howrah South Point has 2 formal schools and a centre for handicapped in the Howrah province right next to Calcutta. The Lalkuthi home in Howrah accommodates 78 handicapped boys and girls. Two experienced physiotherapists are permanently on site to attend the children and provide training to the responsible for their care. A pediatrician monitors the health of the children with weekly visits.</p>
<ImageComp src = "India14-17.jpeg" />
<p>Three other homes located in Jalpaiguri, North Bengal, provide homes for an additional 100 handicapped children. There, in the magnificent foothills of the Himalayas, the children learn to surmount their handicaps through educational facilities, workshops, and farming. A visit to one of those centers, where the odds are beaten every day, where children once condemned to death are given a marvelous second chance, is a profoundly moving experience.</p>

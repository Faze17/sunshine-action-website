    <br />

<div className="row">
    <div>
    <p>Plant the Planet began in 2010 as a way of fighting climate change on Sunshine Action charity trips abroad. New trees were planted on charity trips to countries outside of Hong Kong. Approximately 280,000 of these trees are in Mongolia and China.</p>
 <p>Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, Plant the Planet has been suspended since the beginning of the pandemic. However, once travel restrictions are lifted, the program will resume normal activities.</p>

    <p>Did you know that an area of rainforest the size of a football field is being destroyed every second? Tropical forests cover 23% of the Earth’s land surface but are disappearing at a rate of 4.6 million hectares per year. Trees are crucial to absorbing carbon dioxide and producing the oxygen that helps sustain humanity. They reduced the greenhouse effect by shading our homes and office buildings, and help maintain the environment by preventing soil erosion, maintaining local rainfall patterns, and maintaining populations of plants, animals, and insects.</p>
    <p>Planting trees is one of the cheapest and most effective ways of drawing excess carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. </p>
    <p>Fast Facts according to UN Environmental Program:</p>
    <li>Three-quarters of the world's people rely on wood as their main source of energy.</li>
    <li>On average, each American uses more than 600 pounds of paper and almost 200 board feet of timber per year</li>
    <li>A single mature tree can absorb carbon dioxide at a rate of 22.7 kg/year (48 lbs) and release enough oxygen back into the atmosphere to support 2 human beings.</li>
    <li>One acre of trees annually consumes the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to that produced by driving an average car for 41,483km (26,000 miles). That same acre of trees also produces enough oxygen for 18 people to breathe for a year.</li>

        <p>Sunshine Action works with schools to fundraise, package and distribute Fortune Bags. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, the organization had conducted the Fortune Bag Program in the following schools in the few years preceding the pandemic: </p>
        <li>Kowloon Wah Yan School </li> 
        <li>Yew Chung International School </li>
        <li>Hong Kong International School</li> 
        <li>ESF King George V School </li>
        <li>ESF Bradbury School  </li>
        <li>ESF Beacon Hill School  </li>
        <li>ESF Kennedy School </li>
        <li>ESF Discovery College </li>
        <li>ESF Renaissance College </li>
        <li>ESF West Island School </li>
        <li>Stamford American School Hong Kong </li>
        <p> </p>
        <p><u>How Do Schools Help?</u></p>
        <p>Schools can help support the Fortune Bag Program in several ways:</p>

    <li>Hosting an event – Fortune Bag events require a venue and space for short-term food storage.
        <ul>
            <li>Most food purchased by Sunshine Action would arrive 2-4 days before the packing event and normally in pallets. The items do not need to be stored inside rooms, but preferably under a roof to avoid potential rain.</li>
            <li>Schools must provide space for assembly lines to pack Fortune Bags. The open space should be fit for at least 6 assembly lines, with 3 long tables for each line.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fundraising and collecting donation items – items must be collected for distribution prior to the packing event.
        <ul>
            <li>The target for donations should be the target number of Fortune Bags x 3-4 items per bag. These items must be at least 6 months from expiry date and not be stored in glass containers. During the pandemic, protective masks and other anti-pandemic items are also welcome.</li>
            <li>Schools can also create fundraising events to support the purchase of items for donation.</li>
            <li>On average, the school and students involved collect 50% of the donated content and Sunshine Action covers the remaining 50%.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Providing volunteers – students, parents, and teachers should be involved and volunteering in the packing & distribution of these bags to the final beneficiaries.
        <ul>
        <li>Approximately 15 volunteers are needed per assembly line.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Contact Sunshine Action to learn more and organize an event at your school!</li>

                <BigHeader text = "History of the Fortune Bag Program" />
                <p>This was the first official program of Sunshine Action in 2008 and remains our biggest project after more than a decade. We started with the simple concept that "Everyone Needs to Eat", called our donations Fortune Bags, and used the Festive Seasons as a motivation to donate. </p>
                <p>The first charity organization Sunshine Action donated Fortune Bags to was the HK Women Workers Association and its sister organization, Cleaning Workers’ Association. At that time in early 2008, there was no minimum wage in Hong Kong. Most cleaning workers made an average of only HKD$3,500-4,500 per month (USD$450-580). Many struggled to pay rent and sustain their families but could not apply for social welfare support. </p>

                <p>When Sunny started the Sunshine Fortune Bags program in 2008, there were only a couple of volunteers each season to pack all bags. They borrowed the office from HK Women Workers Association to store the food. Volunteers came on Saturdays and Sundays for 3 consecutive weekends to pack the bags. Sunshine Action did not have its own office until 4 years later. This was the humble beginning of Sunshine Action, the world's smallest charity organization. </p>

                <p>The Fortune Bag Program has since expanded outside of Hong Kong. Sunshine Action began providing Fortune Bags in Macau in 2011. Fortune Bags have also been distributed in Vietnam, Kenya, China, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Hong Kong, Mongolia, India, Nepal, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam & the Philippines. Occasionally, we also donate to local charity kitchens in bulk.</p>
                <p>In addition to distributing Fortune Bags, Sunshine Action has donated food to the poor through the following organizations: </p>
                <li>Blue Sky Food Assistance Serv. Project </li>

                <li>The <b>biggest</b> Sunshine Fortune Bags program conducted in a single morning was during the Mid-Autumn Festival in 2020, donating over 7,500 Sunshine Fortune Bags for the poor and elderly in Hong Kong, through 70 local centres. </li>
                <li>The <b>heaviest</b> Sunshine Fortune Bags were packed during September 2020 for Mid-Autumn Festival and World Food Day, with each bag containing 9-10 items and averaging 9 kg (or roughly 20 lbs) each</li>
                <li>The <b>most expensive</b> Sunshine Fortune Bags were made in May 2019 for Mother's & Father's Day. Each bag included 9 items and was approximately worth HKD$300 (USD$40). A total of 3,000 bags were distributed (total market value of HKD$900,000 or USD$120,000) during this period, making it the single most expensive program ever done in the history of Sunshine Action! </li>

                <p>Sunshine Action works with schools to fundraise, package and distribute Fortune Bags. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, the organization had conducted the Fortune Bag Program in the following schools in the few years preceding the pandemic: </p>
        <li>Kowloon Wah Yan School </li> 
        <li>Yew Chung International School </li>
        <li>Hong Kong International School</li> 
        <li>ESF King George V School </li>
        <li>ESF Bradbury School  </li>
        <li>ESF Beacon Hill School  </li>
        <li>ESF Kennedy School </li>
        <li>ESF Discovery College </li>
        <li>ESF Renaissance College </li>
        <li>ESF West Island School </li>
        <li>Stamford American School Hong Kong </li>
        <SmallHeader text = "How Do Schools Help?" />
        <p>Schools can help support the Fortune Bag Program in several ways:</p>

    <li>Hosting an event – Fortune Bag events require a venue and space for short-term food storage.
        <ul>
            <li>Most food purchased by Sunshine Action would arrive 2-4 days before the packing event and normally in pallets. The items do not need to be stored inside rooms, but preferably under a roof to avoid potential rain.</li>
            <li>Schools must provide space for assembly lines to pack Fortune Bags. The open space should be fit for at least 6 assembly lines, with 3 long tables for each line.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fundraising and collecting donation items – items must be collected for distribution prior to the packing event.
        <ul>
            <li>The target for donations should be the target number of Fortune Bags x 3-4 items per bag. These items must be at least 6 months from expiry date and not be stored in glass containers. During the pandemic, protective masks and other anti-pandemic items are also welcome.</li>
            <li>Schools can also create fundraising events to support the purchase of items for donation.</li>
            <li>On average, the school and students involved collect 50% of the donated content and Sunshine Action covers the remaining 50%.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Providing volunteers – students, parents, and teachers should be involved and volunteering in the packing & distribution of these bags to the final beneficiaries.
        <ul>
        <li>Approximately 15 volunteers are needed per assembly line.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Contact Sunshine Action to learn more and organize an event at your school!</li>

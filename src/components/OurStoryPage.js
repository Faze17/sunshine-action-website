    <p>On January 1st 2008, 3 volunteers founded Sunshine Action with nothing but the mission and heart to serving those in need.
     During a tough economic crisis in Hong Kong, the founder used his own salary to purchase 100 packs of rice to be donated to 100 struggling workers. Since then, the charity has come a long way remaining committed to operating completely on volunteers and donations.</p> 

 

<p>Having worked with 30 organisations in its first year, the charity has quickly grown. 
Today, it is estimated that Sunshine Action has helped over 193,000 people directly, reaching 18 countries worldwide and working with around 400 charitable organisations. 
The charity has widely expanded in volunteers since its creation, having had more than 10,000 individuals helping with itsâ€™ mission. 
Volunteers have participated in the many events and programs which Sunshine Action have hosted over the years, 
consisting mainly in street sleeper projects and handing out of donations.</p> 

 

<p>Sunshine Action continue to expand with bases in the United Kingdom and the United States, 
working with interns to further the vision established at the very heart of the charity: 
staying committed to serving those in need.</p>

    <p>Sunshine Action is always looking for new people to 
        get involved! One of the ways you can help is by 
        volunteering at one of our events. Follow our 
        social media accounts to find out when the next event is happening near you. </p>
    <br />

    <h3><b>What does being a volunteer involve?  </b></h3>

    <p>Most of our upcoming events will focus on food poverty 
        relief for homeless people and low-income families. These events 
        require lots of volunteers to assemble, pack and distribute our food bags. 
        For each event you will be needed for a few hours over one or two consecutive days.  </p>

    <br />

    <p>We are keen to encourage long-term commitment amongst 
        volunteers as our goal is to help people on a regular 
        basis. Taking part in our events is great fun as you 
        get to meet lots of other like-minded volunteers whilst 
        helping the most vulnerable in society.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p>We also run international volunteering tours and overseas
         programs. In the past we have typically visited around 3-5 
         countries per year. These trips allow us to carry out a local
          assessment in target areas to understand the situation on 
          the ground so that we can then provide to the groups in need. 
          These trips are great opportunities to provide food and material
           support to the people around the world who really need it most! </p>
    <br />
